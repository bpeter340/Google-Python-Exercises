# Google-Python-Exercises

###### In 2010 google held a python workshop hosted by Nick Parlante where developers were able to learn about python development. The course which was held over a period of two days was aimed at introducing anyone with some previous development experience to a relatively easy to learn language. _The general idea was that much of python can be grasped in a short amount of time if a person has prior programming experience._

The description and solutions for each task can be in the **Basic** folder in each of the python files.
